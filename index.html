    <h1>Evil Presentation: your source for evil, in a business context<sup><a href='#compatibility'>1</a></sup></h1>

<div id='GETSTARTED'>
<h2>Jump right in</h2>

<form method='POST' action='/presentation'>
<p>Would you like to <input class='button-as-link' type='submit' value='make an evil presentation'>? Or perhaps you would prefer to a bookmark <a href='/presentation'>a random presentation</a> (so the images will be different each time). Once it starts, try clicking it, or whacking your <kbd>spacebar</kbd> or something.</p>

<h2>About evil presentations</h2>

<p>
Why bother spending ages choosing and formatting slides for that big presentation when the power of the internet (mostly monkeys on speed) can do it for you? <em>evilpresentation.com</em> pulls images from <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> tagged appropriately, and builds a presentation out of them. We're careful to ensure that the images are licensed for commercial use, so you can grab a presentation just before going in to that important pitch meeting!
</p>

<p>
Or, why not substitute a rival's presentation for an evil one at the last minute? Just another weapon in your sneaky arsenal against those hard-working fast-climbers.
</p>

<h2>Customise your presentation</h2>

<h2>How we find images</h2>

<p>We use Flickr &quot;machine tags&quot; to identify the images available. You should tag possible opening images with <code>evil:purpose=start</code>, general-purpose images with <code>evil:purpose=middle</code>, and ending images with <code>evil:purpose=end</code>. All images should have a <a href='http://creativecommons.org'>Creative Commons</a> license that allows commercial use. You will be attributed in a presentation for any images used.</p>

</div>

<div class='section'>
<h2>More sophistication</h2>

<p>You can add in additional information such as your name and affiliation, and the title of your presentation, into the URI itself (allowing bookmarking these details while keeping the images random each time); the following are accepted.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em>/<em>[title]</em></code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you <code>POST</code> to these, you will get a redirect to the final (cacheable) URI for your generated presentation; if you use <code>GET</code> then the presentation will be returned directly, and won't be cacheable (but has the advantage of using randomly-selected images each time).</p>

<p><code>POST</code> requests also parse the supplied entity, which should be of type <code>multipart/form-data</code> (to ensure non-ASCII characters work). You can set the following fields: <code>presenter</code>, <code>affiliation</code>, <code>title</code>; and <code>images.start</code>, <code>images.middle</code> and <code>images.end</code> to select how many of each type of image you want. Configuration options provided in the URI override those in the POST request.</p>

<h2 id='compatibility'>1: Compatibility</h2>

<p>This site should work in all browsers except Opera, which doesn't work with S5 for reasons I can't be bothered to sort out. It clearly worked at some point; I'm guessing Opera decided they'd get clever and change the way their META extensions work, so it's really their own fault. The creators of <code>evilpresentation.com</code> will not offer opinions on its compatibility with your particular business.</p>
