    <h1>Evil Presentations</h1>

<h2>Jump right in</h2>

<p>Do you want to <a href='presentation'>make a presentation</a>?</p>

<h2>Experimental funkiness</h2>

<p>This probably won't work.</p>

<h2>About <em>evilpresentation</em></h2>

<p>
Why bother spending ages choosing and formatting slides for that big presentation when the power of the internet (mostly monkeys on speed) can do it for you? <em>evilpresentation</em> pulls photos from <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> tagged appropriately, and builds a presentation out of them.
</p>

<p>
Or, why not substitute a rival's presentation for an evil one at the last minute? Just another weapon in your sneaky arsenal against those hard-working fast-climbers.
</p>

<h2>The gritty details</h2>

<p>If you want it more customised, you can add in additional information such as your name and affiliation, and the title of your presentation. This goes into the URI itself; the following are accepted.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em>/<em>[title]</em></code></li>
</ul>

<p>We use Flickr &quot;machine tags&quot; to identify the images available. You should tag possible opening images with <code>evil:purpose=start</code>, general-purpose images with <code>evil:purpose=middle</code>, and ending photos with <code>evil:purpose=end</code>. All photos should have a <a href='http://creativecommons.org'>Creative Commons</a> license that allows commercial use. You will be attributed in a presentation for any images used.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
This is very much pre-release, so please do not spread around yet. In particular, there's an approach I want to take which will reduce the load on Flickr and also make the final presentations bookmarkable.
