<h2>Jump right in</h2>

<form method='POST' action='/presentation'>
<p>Would you like to <input type='submit' value='make an evil presentation'>? Or perhaps you would prefer to a bookmark <a href='/presentation'>a random presentation</a> (so the images will be different each time).</p>
</form>

<h2>About evil presentations</h2>

<p>
Why bother spending ages choosing and formatting slides for that big presentation when the power of the internet (mostly monkeys on speed) can do it for you? <em>evilpresentation.com</em> pulls images from <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> tagged appropriately, and builds a presentation out of them. We're careful to ensure that the images are licensed for commercial use, so you can grab a presentation just before going in to that important pitch meeting!
</p>

<p>
Or, why not substitute a rival's presentation for an evil one at the last minute? Just another weapon in your sneaky arsenal against those hard-working fast-climbers.
</p>

<h2>The gritty details</h2>

<p>If you want it more customised, you can add in additional information such as your name and affiliation, and the title of your presentation. This goes into the URI itself; the following are accepted. If you <code>POST</code> to the following URIs, you will get a redirect to the final (cacheable) URI for your generated presentation; if you use <code>GET</code> then the URI won't redirect, and won't be cacheable (but has the advantage of using randomly-selected images each time).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em></code></li>
<li><code>http://evilpresentation.com/presentation/<em>[author]</em>;<em>[affiliation]</em>/<em>[title]</em></code></li>
</ul>

<p>We use Flickr &quot;machine tags&quot; to identify the images available. You should tag possible opening images with <code>evil:purpose=start</code>, general-purpose images with <code>evil:purpose=middle</code>, and ending images with <code>evil:purpose=end</code>. All images should have a <a href='http://creativecommons.org'>Creative Commons</a> license that allows commercial use. You will be attributed in a presentation for any images used.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
This is very much pre-release, so please do not spread around yet. I'd really like to get the body of <code>POST</code> to mean something, probably by containing some <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> data. And encrypting the Flickr gubbins might make me more popular. Oh, and using Twisted instead of CGI invocation.
