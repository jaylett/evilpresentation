# Evil Presentations

Why bother spending ages choosing and formatting slides for that big
presentation when the power of the internet (mostly monkeys on speed)
can do it for you? _evilpresentation_ pulls images from Flickr
tagged appropriately, and builds a presentation out of them. We're
careful to ensure that the images are licensed for commercial use, so
you can grab a presentation just before going in to that important
pitch meeting!

This is very much an abandoned software curiosity, and given its age
probably doesn't work even if you can figure out how to set it up. (Do
those Flickr APIs still exist? No idea.)

There's an API key in an early commit, but it's now disabled.
